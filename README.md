# cs50-finance
This was my CS50 finance solution. It is a website that allows users to lookup, buy, and sell stocks based on their real stock market price.

## Tech Stack
This project uses Python (flask) and the IEX cloud API for the stock prices.

## Functionality
- Users can go to the 'quote' tab and type in a stock symbol to lookup the current price of a stock.
- Users can "buy" stocks using their wallet ($10,000 by default) in the 'buy' tab.
- Users can view their portfolio at the home/index page.
- Users can "sell" their stocks in the 'sell' tab.
- Users can view the history of their buys/purchases in the 'history' tab.
